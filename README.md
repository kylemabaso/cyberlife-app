## Plugins

I utilized a few plugins in this project

- TailwindCSS - I didn't want to have to write a lot of CSS given the time constraints (https://tailwindcss.com/).
- Reach Datez as I was looking for something unique (https://www.npmjs.com/package/react-datez).
- React Color - I won't lie, I just had to be dramatic on this one (https://www.npmjs.com/package/react-color).
